# Testing the behaviour of TC and CT rules offload.
#
# The Driver/FW/HW does not support all the possibilities offered by the kernel.
#
# Let's check here that:
#
#       1) the HW can install those rules we do support. This needs to cover filters and actions.
#       2) the HW will not install those rules with unsupported filters or actions.
#       3) the HW will install those specific rules requiring "translation" like LHS to RHS rules.
#
#       how to check the outcome is as expected? Only looking at the filters installed or maybe looking
#       at driver logs as well?

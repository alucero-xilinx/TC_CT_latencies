Current unit tests implemented are the same for the single and dual machine
scenarios, although obviously with different configuration (unit tests files).
VXLAN is included for the dual one. 
All the testing is ipv4 based.
ARP redirection rules always.

- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching TCP.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP and IP address.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP and port number.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP, IP address and port number.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP with Conntrack.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching TCP with Conntrack.


TODO
====
- IPv6
- OVS
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP with Conntrack, isolation per zone.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching TCP with Conntrack, isolation per zone.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching IP and TTL.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching IP, decrementing TTL.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP, doing DNAT in one way (client) and SNAT the other one.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching TCP, doing DNAT in one way (client) and SNAT the other one.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching UDP, doing SNAT in one way (client) and DNAT the other one.
- Redirection between VFs based on matching TCP, doing SNAT in one way (client) and DNAT the other one.

- Checking supported hardware offload rules, matching and actions. No data exchange.
